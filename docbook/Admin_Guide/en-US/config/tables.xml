	<para>MantisBT enables users to configure a table prefix for all its
		tables. This is useful to be able to have multiple MantisBT
		installation in the same database. The advantage of that is for
		users who are limited by their ISP to have one database.

				<para>Specifies the prefix to be use for all table names. The
					default value is 'mantis'. If you override the default prefix, make
					sure to update doc/db_generate.sql file before generating your
					database. The other option is to import db_generate.sql as is, then
					rename the tables to match the new prefix.
				</para>

				<para>The prefix is used to help make sure table names are unique.
					This is useful for users who are limited to one database.
				</para>
				<note><para>
						The table name for each of the tables is stored in a variable which
						is calculated based on this configuration option. If you change the
						prefix you have to make sure these variables are re-calculated (by
						adding these calculation statements to config_inc.php after
						assigning the new prefix). An example of these variables is:
						$g_mantis_bug_file_table
