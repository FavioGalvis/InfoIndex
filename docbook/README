= Mantis Documentation =

This directory contains sources for the Mantis Documentation.

We are using Docbook XML to write manuals, and Publican[1] to manage the build to the final formats (PDF, HTML, etc).


== Building ==

Building documentation requires Publican, available on most Linux distributions and Windows[2]

Once installed, build the documentation with:

cd Admin_Guide
publican build --formats=pdf,html --langs=en-US
